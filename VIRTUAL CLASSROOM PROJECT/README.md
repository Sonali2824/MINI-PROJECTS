<h2> Project Title : Virtual Classroom </h2><br>


### ⚡ Problem Statement: 👩‍🏫 Owing to the current COVID-19 conditions, schools and colleges have become virtual. All notes, assignments, projects, attendance forms, marksheets, examination question papers and answer scripts, and other related documents are shared and uploaded online. But all these documents are collected and shared in different forums. Multiple announcements, important notes and messages are all shared at once, due to which both the students and faculty might miss out on some. Faculty find it difficult to track the submissions made by the students. We require a more organized mechanism to perform these functionalities. 👨‍🏫 </i>

### ⚡ Proposed System: 💻The proposed system is a common forum in which all required resources are added by the faculty members and which can then be accessed by the students, that takes up the form of a website.

## ✨PROJECT EXPLANATION
📝 Owing to the current COVID-19 conditions, schools and colleges have become virtual. All academic related resources and information are shared via different online platforms. <br><br>
📝Despite all the information being shared with the students, it is difficult for the student to keep track of the work to be done owing to the greater number of messages or emails received each day. Students tend to miss out on important dates and other vital information that makes them fall behind in their work. Despite all the documents and links being shared, at a time of need, it is difficult to find the same and trace back the work owing to the multiple groups and information overload. <br><br>
📝From the perspective of the faculty, they find it difficult to keep track of the following components:
1.	Whether all syllabi related resources have been shared with the students.
2.	Whether they have assigned and shared the link for submission for the designated number of assignments, quizzes, examinations, and projects.
3.	Whether all announcements and vital information has been shared with the students.

<br><br>
📝So it is important to have an advanced/intelligent waste management system to manage a variety of waste materials.<br><br>
📝Large organizations like companies, schools, stores, restaurants and other commercial and institutional buildings generate significant amounts of materials and waste. In these organizations, it is a very challenging job to ensure all the individuals follow the waste segregation methods. So, these large organizations are the main target for our solution.<br><br>

📝The proposed solution is an Automatic Waste Segregator,” The Autowastagator”.

        💥The Automatic Waste Segregator was built using an Image Classification model using the ResNet50 model. The model will be built on a Waste Images Dataset procured from different resources in order to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the model.
        
        💥The data was collected from Kaggle waste classification dataset and Trashnet dataset .The dataset is then trained and tested and a model is created. The input to the model will be a video input where the video comprises of trash being thrown.

        💥Video is split into frames(1 image for every 7s of video). Predication are made on frames
        
        💥 As already mentioned the target audience will be members of a large organization where there is a high probability only one trash is thrown at a time which is then recorded by a webcam and then the waste category classification is done on the recorded video.
        
        💥 At the end of the process a report is generated comprising of the details of the number of images (obtained from video stream) of each category of waste disposed.

📝  <b>The waste report</b> generated in this proposed system, provides essential information related to the trash disposed. This information can be utilized to take necessary steps to dispose / recycle these wastes using correct methodologies.
<br></br>
📝 The separation process of the waste will be faster and intelligent using the proposed waste material classification system without or reducing human involvement.
