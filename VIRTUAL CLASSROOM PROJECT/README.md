# Virtual Classroom
<i>
<h2> Project Title : Virtual Classroom </h2><br>


### ⚡ Problem Statement: 👩‍🏫 Owing to the current COVID-19 conditions, schools and colleges have become virtual. All notes, assignments, projects, attendance forms, marksheets, examination question papers and answer scripts, and other related documents are shared and uploaded online. But all these documents are collected and shared in different forums. Multiple announcements, important notes and messages are all shared at once, due to which both the students and faculty might miss out on some. Faculty find it difficult to track the submissions made by the students. We require a more organized mechanism to perform these functionalities. 👨‍🏫 </i>

### ⚡ Proposed System: 💻The proposed system is a common forum in which all required resources are added by the faculty members and which can then be accessed by the students, that takes up the form of a website.

## 🧾PROJECT EXPLANATION
📝 Owing to the current COVID-19 conditions, schools and colleges have become virtual. All academic related resources and information are shared via different online platforms. <br><br>
📝Despite all the information being shared with the students, it is difficult for the student to keep track of the work to be done owing to the greater number of messages or emails received each day. Students tend to miss out on important dates and other vital information that makes them fall behind in their work. Despite all the documents and links being shared, at a time of need, it is difficult to find the same and trace back the work owing to the multiple groups and information overload. <br><br>
📝From the perspective of the faculty, they find it difficult to keep track of the following components:
* Whether all syllabi related resources have been shared with the students.
* Whether they have assigned and shared the link for submission for the designated number of assignments, quizzes, examinations, and projects.
* Whether all announcements and vital information has been shared with the students.
<br><br><br>
📝Thus, there is a requirement from the students' end to view all the work to be done and the learning resources in a more organized manner and from the faculty’s end an organized mechanism to share all information and resources with their students. Both the faculty and students require an organized and efficient method to track their work.<br><br>
📝The proposed solution is the website, "Academizer".
