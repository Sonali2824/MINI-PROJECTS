## ✨PROJECT EXPLANATION
📝 The accumulation of waste in the urban area is becoming a great concern, and it would result in environmental pollution and may be hazardous to human health if it is not properly managed.<br><br>
📝In India, 77% of waste is disposed of in open dumps,18% is composted and just 5% is recycled. This improper disposal of waste has led to generation of huge amounts of CO2. <br><br>
📝One of the most important steps of waste management is the separation of the waste into the different components and this process is normally done manually by hand-picking. <br><br>
📝So it is important to have an advanced/intelligent waste management system to manage a variety of waste materials.<br><br>
📝Large organizations like companies, schools, stores, restaurants and other commercial and institutional buildings generate significant amounts of materials and waste. In these organizations, it is a very challenging job to ensure all the individuals follow the waste segregation methods. So, these large organizations are the main target for our solution.<br><br>

📝The proposed solution is an Automatic Waste Segregator,” The Autowastagator”.

        💥The Automatic Waste Segregator was built using an Image Classification model using the ResNet50 model. The model will be built on a Waste Images Dataset procured from different resources in order to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the model.
        
        💥The data was collected from Kaggle waste classification dataset and Trashnet dataset .The dataset is then trained and tested and a model is created. The input to the model will be a video input where the video comprises of trash being thrown.

        💥Video is split into frames(1 image for every 7s of video). Predication are made on frames
        
        💥 As already mentioned the target audience will be members of a large organization where there is a high probability only one trash is thrown at a time which is then recorded by a webcam and then the waste category classification is done on the recorded video.
        
        💥 At the end of the process a report is generated comprising of the details of the number of images (obtained from video stream) of each category of waste disposed.

📝  <b>The waste report</b> generated in this proposed system, provides essential information related to the trash disposed. This information can be utilized to take necessary steps to dispose / recycle these wastes using correct methodologies.
<br></br>
📝 The separation process of the waste will be faster and intelligent using the proposed waste material classification system without or reducing human involvement.
