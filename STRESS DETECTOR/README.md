![Architecture](https://github.com/Sonali2824/MINI-PROJECTS/blob/master/STRESS%20DETECTOR/ARCHITECTURE.png?raw=true)
The architecture comprises of the following components:
1. When the program is run, the Employee enters his/her name and ID.
2. The stress detector is then started.
3. Then the system checks conditions:
a) If emotions sad or scared is detected and ,count >20,and
b) If the value of drowsy==1
4. If all conditions are satisfied stress is detected. If any of the condition is not satisfied
stress is not detected.
5. If stress is detected, the user is given the choice of continuing to work or not. If he/she
wishes to continue to work, a mail is sent to the health care unit and the stress detector
starts again. If he/she doesnâ€™t want to work any further, the program breaks.

The instructions to run main.py is provided in the instructions pdf
